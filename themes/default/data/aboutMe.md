Hello! Please call me **Taq**. I like building things.
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
I'm an engineer and educator. Lately, I've been focusing super hard on [honey.is](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=sharehoney) during the day, teaching javascript and programming on the weekends, and building teaching tools and other cool stuff at night. 
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
    **Here's a select list of some of my recent projects.**
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
**[Gitbot](http://fewd.us/gitbot)**
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
A one click github repo <i class="long arrow right icon"></i> github pages deployment service. Almost completely static (one cURL for handling access_token exchange is required). Logs you in to your Github, displays repos, allows you to port to gh-pages without a line of code.
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
**[LaunchPad](http://taqquikarim.com/launchpad/)**
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
An organizational tool for managating articles and inspiration. It is pinterest for project managment â€” but not as pretty and a tad more functional.
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
**[StatikPress](http://mottaquikarim.github.io/statikPress/)**
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
A super simple static site generator implemented in NodeJS with promises.
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
**[gulpSmartSrc](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/gulpSmartSrc)**
</p>

<p class="lightgraph">
Allows concatenation of both local files and urls into bundle.js
</p>

    **Getting in touch**

<p class="lightgraph">
    For a more comprehensive look at my work, be sure to check out my **[github](https://github.com/mottaquikarim)** (though the _real_ good stuff lives on private repos on **[gitlab](http://gitlab.com)**). 
</p>
<p class="lightgraph">
    For teaching resources, have a look at this github **[organization](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials)** I maintain or my current tools homepage, **[fewd.us](http://fewd.us)**.
</p>
<p class="lightgraph">
    Sometimes I'll share my **[hardware hacks](https://www.instagram.com/p/82FeLxNDzo/?taken-by=taqqui.karim)** and **[tinkering results](https://www.instagram.com/p/8rARZNND_t/?taken-by=taqqui.karim)** on my **[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/taqqui.karim/)**.
